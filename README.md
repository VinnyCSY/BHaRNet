### Abstract
> In skeleton-based human action recognition, most existing methods primarily focus on full-body movements while overlooking subtle hand motions that are crucial for distinguishing fine-grained actions. We propose **BHaRNet** (**B**odyâ€“**H**and **a**ction **R**ecognition **Net**work), a novel framework that augments a body-expert model with a complementary hand-expert model. BHaRNet includes diverse variants (BHaRNet-P, BHaRNet-E, BHaRNet-B, and BHaRNet-M), built upon a dual-stream network, and can be extended to lightweight configurations and multi-modal settings with RGB input. Experiments on large-scale benchmarks (NTU RGB+D 60, NTU RGB+D 120, PKU-MMD, and Northwestern-UCLA) show that BHaRNet achieves state-of-the-art or highly competitive performance with high efficiency.
